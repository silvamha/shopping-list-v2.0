## 01 Logic to numberOfItems
1. User enters item and price
2. Clicks enter items button
3. Elements are dynamically populated
4. The order of the elements from left to right should be:
item, actualPrice, numberOfItems, fixedPrice, isPurchased
5. Once the user enters number of items, the actualPrice and fixedPrice shoudl adjust accordingly as these numbers will later be totalled and used for analysis.

Please help me make the necessary modfications to the code witout altering it any more than the absolutely necessary.
