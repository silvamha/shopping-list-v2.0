## 01 There is a bug with the checkboxes that get them unchecked but I cannot pinpoint the cause. For now, the application is functional but this bug will need to be addressed later.
The issue you're encountering where clicking outside a checkbox or the actual price input unchecks all checkboxes is unusual. It suggests there might be an unintended global event listener affecting your checkboxes, or a script that's reacting to unintended events and altering the checkboxes' states.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to debug and fix the issue:

1. **Check for Global Event Listeners**: Look through your code for any event listeners attached to the `document`, `body`, or other large container elements that might be firing when you don't intend them to.

2. **Isolate the Event**: Use `console.log` inside your event listeners to determine which event is causing the problem. If there are listeners on the document or other large elements, ensure they’re not unintentionally affecting your checkboxes.

3. **Prevent Event Propagation**: If the issue is due to event bubbling up the DOM, you can stop the propagation of the event using `event.stopPropagation()` within your event listeners.

Here's an example of how you can use `event.stopPropagation()`:

```javascript
// Inside your checkbox event listener
isPurchasedCheckbox.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  // ... rest of your code ...
});
```

And you would do the same for the actual price input:

```javascript
// Inside your actualPriceInput event listener
actualPriceInput.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
  event.stopPropagation();
  // ... rest of your code ...
});
```

4. **Check the Logic**: Ensure there’s no part of your code that resets the checkboxes unintentionally. For instance, if you have a function that's supposed to run when a specific checkbox is clicked but it’s affecting all checkboxes, you’ll need to adjust that logic.

5. **Inspect Element States**: Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect the checkboxes and see if there’s any JavaScript manipulating their state. Sometimes third-party extensions or other scripts loaded on the page can cause unexpected behavior.

6. **Review Dynamic Element Creation**: When dynamically creating checkboxes, make sure each checkbox has a unique ID or data attribute. If you're using a loop to create them, ensure the loop doesn't have side effects that reset the state of other checkboxes.

If you're still unable to resolve the issue, please provide the relevant sections of your code where the checkboxes and actual price inputs are being handled, and I can give you more targeted advice.

## 02 Checkbox bug fixed
Certainly! To ensure that the `isPurchased` checkboxes retain their checked state based on the database values when the page reloads, you'll need to modify how you create and set these checkboxes in the `createElements` function. The key is to set the `checked` attribute of each checkbox according to the `isPurchased` value from the database for each item.

Here's how you can adjust the `createElements` function:

```javascript
const createElements = (
  itemValue,
  fixedPriceValue,
  uniqueKey,
  actualPrice,
  isPurchased
) => {
  // ... other code ...

  // Checkbox for marking the item as purchased
  const isPurchasedCheckbox = document.createElement("input");
  isPurchasedCheckbox.type = "checkbox";
  isPurchasedCheckbox.className = "is-purchased-checkbox";
  isPurchasedCheckbox.checked = isPurchased; // Set the checkbox based on the isPurchased value from the database
  isPurchasedCheckbox.setAttribute("data-id", uniqueKey);

  // Event listener for when the checkbox is updated
  isPurchasedCheckbox.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
    // ... event handling code ...
  });

  // Append all created elements to the item container div
  itemContainer.appendChild(isPurchasedCheckbox);

  // Disable inputs if the item is already purchased
  if (isPurchased) {
    listItem.disabled = true;
    fixedPriceDisplay.disabled = true;
    actualPriceInput.disabled = true;
  }

  // Finally, append the item container to the main list container in the DOM
  listContainerDIV.appendChild(itemContainer);
};
```

In the `onValue` listener, make sure you're passing the `isPurchased` value to the `createElements` function:

```javascript
onValue(dbRef, (snapshot) => {
  listContainerDIV.innerHTML = ""; // Clear existing items
  const items = snapshot.val();
  if (items) {
    Object.keys(items).forEach((key) => {
      const item = items[key];
      createElements(item.item, item.fixedPrice, key, item.actualPrice, item.isPurchased);
    });
  }
});
```

With these changes, when your page loads and fetches data from Firebase, it will create checkboxes with their `checked` state set according to the `isPurchased` value stored in your database. This ensures that checkboxes will display as checked or unchecked based on their last saved state.
