## 01 Worked on responsiveness for smart phones. The fix is temporary
To adjust the size of the `numberOfItems` input field for better display on smartphones, you can use CSS media queries. These queries will apply specific styles when the screen size falls below a certain width, allowing for a more responsive design.

Based on your current CSS, you can modify the `.number-of-items-input` class within the `@media (max-width: 500px)` media query. This query targets devices with screen widths of 500px or less, which typically includes smartphones.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
@media (max-width: 500px) {
    .list-item-container {
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: stretch;
    }

    .list-item-container input[type="text"],
    .list-item-container input[type="number"] {
        width: auto; /* Adjust the width as needed */
        flex-grow: 1; /* This makes the input fields grow to fill available space */
    }

    .number-of-items-input {
        width: 30%; /* Adjust this width as needed */
        flex-grow: 0; /* Prevents the field from growing */
    }

    .fixed-price {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Flex Direction**: In the media query for screens smaller than 500px, I've set the `.list-item-container` to have a `flex-direction` of `column`. This stacks the inputs vertically, which can be more space-efficient on narrow screens. If you prefer them side by side, change it back to `row`.
- **Input Field Widths**: For the text and number input fields, `width: auto;` and `flex-grow: 1;` ensure they expand to use the available space.
- **Number of Items Input**: The `.number-of-items-input` class has been specifically targeted to adjust its width. The `width: 30%;` is an example; you can modify this percentage to suit your design needs. Setting `flex-grow: 0;` ensures this field doesn't expand beyond the specified width.
- **Fixed Price**: The `.fixed-price` class is set to `display: none;` for screens smaller than 500px, assuming you want to hide this on smaller screens.

### Testing on a Smartphone:

After updating your CSS, test the display on an actual smartphone to see how the changes look. You can use the browser's developer tools to simulate various screen sizes for initial testing, but always verify on a real device for accuracy.

Adjust the percentage values and flex properties as needed to achieve the desired layout on small screens.
